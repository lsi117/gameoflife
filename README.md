### The Inspiration

I created this game based on [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). There are some rules before making this "zero player" game. Be sure to check out the rules in the link provided above.

### Rules:
  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
  Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
  Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.


In addition to this being based on Conway's Game of Life, I've also had the inspiration to turn on of my artworks called, ![Cells](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/obn70013yu1vlkn/AACWiLLZOT7xprEgVPOMCI5na?dl=0&preview=Cells+(A+visual+representation+of+transparency).jpg) into a real life game. I think that this was the best way to pull it off.

## The Technologies

This is an application built with `React`. I figured that if i'm going to improve my skills in React that I could start with this.
